This research investigates the effectiveness of information provision for congestion reduction in Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) systems. It proposes a reinforcement learning framework involving CAVs and an information provider, where CAVs conduct real-time learning to minimize their individual travel time, while the information provider offers real-time route suggestions aiming to minimize the system’s total travel time. The routing problem of the CAVs is formulated as a Markov game and the information provision problem is formulated as a single-agent Markov decision process. Then, this research develops a customized two-way deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the interrelated problems. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves the realization of Correlated Equilibrium (CE) and that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate congestion without compromising individual user optimality. This research contributes to the advancement of congestion reduction strategies in CAV systems with the mitigation of the conflict between system-level and individual-level goals using CE as a theoretical foundation. The results highlight the potential of information provision in fostering coordination and correlation among CAVs, thereby enhancing traffic efficiency and achieving system-level goals in smart transportation. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191261524001383">Read More</a>

This paper proposes a within-day dynamic traffic equilibrium model that explicitly formulates strategic information provision as an endogenous element. The proposed model considers travelers’ reactions to the information, creating an interdependent relationship between provided information and traffic dynamics. In this framework, two classes of travelers receive different types of travel time information: one class receives instantaneous travel time reflecting the prevailing traffic conditions, while the other class receives strategic forecasts of travel times, generated by accounting for travelers’ reactions to instantaneous information based on strategic thinking from behavioral game theory. The resulting multi-class within-day dynamic equilibrium differs from existing models by explicitly modeling information provision and consideration of information consistency. The inherent dynamics of real-time updated traffic information, traffic conditions, and travelers’ choice behaviors are analytically modeled, with the resulting dynamic equilibrium formulated as a fixed-point problem. The theoretical propositions and numerical findings offer rich insights into the impact of information on the traffic network, strategic forecast information penetration, the relationship between the proposed equilibrium and traditional dynamic traffic equilibria, and information accuracy. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0968090X25002736">Read More</a>

The growing conflict between parking demand and limited curbside space highlights the need for efficient on-street parking management. Freight and service vehicles, in particular, pose high societal costs when parking is unavailable, often leading to double parking, congestion, and safety risks. Given their essential services, prioritising these vehicles in parking allocation is critical. However, research in this area remains limited. This research proposes an optimisation model that allocates on-street parking among passenger cars, freight, and service vehicles, considering their distinct impacts. Using a queuing theory framework, the model ensures parking availability for prioritised vehicles and optimises car parking time limits. The objective is to minimise negative societal externalities caused by insufficient parking. A case study shows that the model effectively prioritises freight and service vehicles and adjusts car parking limits to meet the goal, along with rich managerial insights. The model offers planners a flexible tool to balance parking utilisation and traffic efficiency. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23249935.2025.2498671">Read More</a>
