This research investigates the effectiveness of information provision for congestion reduction in Connected Autonomous Vehicle (CAV) systems. It proposes a reinforcement learning framework involving CAVs and an information provider, where CAVs conduct real-time learning to minimize their individual travel time, while the information provider offers real-time route suggestions aiming to minimize the system’s total travel time. The routing problem of the CAVs is formulated as a Markov game and the information provision problem is formulated as a single-agent Markov decision process. Then, this research develops a customized two-way deep reinforcement learning approach to solve the interrelated problems. Theoretical analysis rigorously proves the realization of Correlated Equilibrium (CE) and that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate congestion without compromising individual user optimality. This research contributes to the advancement of congestion reduction strategies in CAV systems with the mitigation of the conflict between system-level and individual-level goals using CE as a theoretical foundation. The results highlight the potential of information provision in fostering coordination and correlation among CAVs, thereby enhancing traffic efficiency and achieving system-level goals in smart transportation. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191261524001383">Read More</a>

This paper proposes a within-day dynamic traffic equilibrium model that explicitly formulates strategic information provision as an endogenous element. The proposed model considers travelers’ reactions to the information, creating an interdependent relationship between provided information and traffic dynamics. In this framework, two classes of travelers receive different types of travel time information: one class receives instantaneous travel time reflecting the prevailing traffic conditions, while the other class receives strategic forecasts of travel times, generated by accounting for travelers’ reactions to instantaneous information based on strategic thinking from behavioral game theory. The resulting multi-class within-day dynamic equilibrium differs from existing models by explicitly modeling information provision and consideration of information consistency. The inherent dynamics of real-time updated traffic information, traffic conditions, and travelers’ choice behaviors are analytically modeled, with the resulting dynamic equilibrium formulated as a fixed-point problem. The theoretical propositions and numerical findings offer rich insights into the impact of information on the traffic network, strategic forecast information penetration, the relationship between the proposed equilibrium and traditional dynamic traffic equilibria, and information accuracy. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0968090X25002736">Read More</a>

<div style="text-align: justify;">
The growing conflict between parking demand and limited curbside space highlights the need for efficient on-street parking management. Freight and service vehicles, in particular, pose high societal costs when parking is unavailable, often leading to double parking, congestion, and safety risks. Given their essential services, prioritising these vehicles in parking allocation is critical. However, research in this area remains limited. This research proposes an optimisation model that allocates on-street parking among passenger cars, freight, and service vehicles, considering their distinct impacts. Using a queuing theory framework, the model ensures parking availability for prioritised vehicles and optimises car parking time limits. The objective is to minimise negative societal externalities caused by insufficient parking. A case study shows that the model effectively prioritises freight and service vehicles and adjusts car parking limits to meet the goal, along with rich managerial insights. The model offers planners a flexible tool to balance parking utilisation and traffic efficiency. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23249935.2025.2498671">Read More</a>

### >> Management of long-term traffic evolution

- #### Period-to-period toll adjustment schemes for mixed traffic with time-varying electric vehicle penetration

<div style="text-align: justify;">
As electric vehicle (EV) penetration increases, the mixed traffic of EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) will be prevalent in roadway systems for a long time. Meanwhile, EV incentive policies, adjusted adaptively as a response to EV market growth, will perturb the mixed traffic pattern periodically. Such periodic perturbation will cause mixed traffic to evolve from disequilibrium to a new equilibrium. This equilibration is theoretically indeterminate due to the non-uniqueness of mixed traffic equilibria and the dynamic interaction between operational policy and underlying mixed traffic. The non-unique mixed-traffic equilibrium in the previous period influences the traffic stationary state and traffic evolution trajectory in the next period, which is also non-unique. Thereby, the indeterminacy in the equilibration process affects the long-term mixed traffic performance that should be factored into the period-to-period adjustment of EV incentive policies. This effect calls for the study of mixed traffic equilibration as a theoretical foundation for longterm policymaking, which has not received significant attention. This paper explores the properties of mixed traffic equilibria and proposes a mixed traffic evolution model considering timevarying EV penetration. The mixed traffic evolution model is then integrated into a control framework to support the period-to-period adjustment of EV-promoting tolling policy. Numerical
examples illustrate the effects of non-unique mixed traffic equilibria and period-to-period toll adjustment schemes on long-term mixed traffic performance. <a href="">Read More</a>

- #### A day-to-day dynamic evolution model and pricing scheme with bi-objective user equilibrium

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Travel time and monetary cost are the two important factors influencing travelers’ route choice behavior. Rather than combining them together as a single objective, a bi-objective user equilibrium (BUE) has been recently proposed in which travelers consider the two objectives separately. It has been shown that BUE can explain more possible route choice results in reality. Therefore, regarding the BUE state as the final steady state of traffic flow evolution, this study develops a BUE-based day-to-day dynamic model by introducing BUE into the well-known proportional-switch adjustment process (PSAP). The equivalence between the steady state of the evolution process of BUE-PSAP and a BUE state, as well as the convergence of the BUE-PSAP are proved. Moreover, a dynamic pricing scheme is proposed to reduce the system total travel time and shrink the BUE solution set. Numerical examples are conducted to validate the proposed dynamic model and the pricing scheme. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21680566.2020.1851311">Read More</a>
