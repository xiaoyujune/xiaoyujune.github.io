My research interests include: 

- Network modeling, simulation, and optimization for intelligent transportation systems
- AI/learning-based mobility solutions
- Smart infrastructure

<br>

***I believe that research should be grounded in real-world problems, not blindly driven by trending buzzwords or fashionable tools. 
My goal is to uncover fundamental scientific insights, develop innovative methodologies, and generate actionable knowledge that empowers both researchers and practitioners, 
ultimately improving peopleâ€™s lives.***
